### Networking-between-2-C-programs
Networking assignment that I have to complete in the next 3 days

# How to run:
- First run the server with:  
gcc server.c   
./a.out  
  
- Next, run the client with:  
gcc client.c  
./a.out  
 
## What is the whole point?

This project is supposed to make a mini version of networking where
a server and a client communicate with each other in order for the 
client to be able to download some files from the native directory of
the server to its own.
